## Laptop Price Predictor Web App

This project is a Flask-based web application that predicts laptop prices based on user input features. The app uses a machine learning model trained on laptop specifications such as RAM, weight, company, type, operating system, CPU, GPU, touchscreen, and IPS display.

### Features

- User-friendly web form for entering laptop specifications
- Encodes categorical features for model prediction
- Loads a pre-trained model using `pickle`
- Displays the estimated price instantly

### How It Works

1. The user enters laptop details in the web form.
2. The app processes the input and encodes features for the model.
3. The trained model predicts the price, which is displayed on the page.

### Tech Stack

- Python
- Flask
- scikit-learn
